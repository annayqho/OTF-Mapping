Note: to (re)run the CASA calibration pipeline on data using the
special "vlass" pipeline mode here at the AOC, here are the
instructions.

0. You need to have the SDM in the directory you are running this,
   below I assume its name is <sdmname>

1. Start casa-pipe
   % casa-pipe -r 4.6.0-vlass
   Note: to see what versions available do
   % casa-pipe -ls

2. Inside this casa import the pipeline recipe, this one with no plotting
   > import pipeline.recipes.hifv_vlass_noplots as hifv_vlass_noplots

3. To run this recipe,
   > hifv_vlass_noplots.hifv(['<sdmname>'])

4. wait for it to finish, about 15 hours for each 1 hour of data on a
   cluster node :(
