Quick guide to VLASS data and scripts

============================================================

A list of important VLASS test datasets is at:
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/vlass-testobs.txt
I try to keep this up-to-date

You can also look in the VLA archive under TSKY0001 and eventually
TVPILOT codes.

I have some of the SDM resident on disk in 
/lustre/aoc/projects/vlass/smyers
and you can just "cp -rf" this, but in general you can download a copy
yourself from the archive in the usual way.

As an example a recent M31 dataset is there as
TSKY0001.sb32154065.eb32157201.57530.47058900463
so go to the directory in which you want to work and either
% cp -rf /lustre/aoc/projects/vlass/smyers/TSKY0001.sb32154065.eb32157201.57530.47058900463 .
(e.g. if you are going to run the pipeline) or point the scripts below to this SDM directly.

Note, the other M31 SDM of interest is the very first one from last year, its the one to
also run and compare to!
TSKY0001.sb30647879.eb30653507.57149.82925858797

An example calibration script is at:
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/scripts/run_TSKY0001_M31_1_sb32154065_57530_calib.py
This calibrates a particular M31 VLASS test block. You would change
stuff in the header to make it work on another dataset.

Example imaging scripts are at:
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/scripts/run_TSKY0001_M31_1_L3600_allsubtiles.py
which runs the generic script
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/scripts/run_QuickLook_SubtilePreset_submosaic_tclean_mfs2048MHz_Pipe.py
This assumes you run it after running the above calibration script. It
also needs the script for getfieldcone.py
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/scripts/getfieldcone.py

There is another version modified for CASA Pipeline MS
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/vlass/scripts/run_TSKY0001_M31_1_L3600_allsubtiles_pipe.py

Note to run your stuff you would just modify the first of the imaging
scripts to point to your files, directories, etc.

You also specify the center of the "tile" and its dimensions in RA and
Dec. If your "tile" has a strange shape you would have to modify the
two imagign scripts to handle that. Maybe I'll think of a better way
to define this in just one script.

Note: to (re)run the CASA calibration pipeline on data using the
special "vlass" pipeline mode here at the AOC, here are the
instructions.

0. You need to have the SDM in the directory you are running this,
   below I assume its name is <sdmname>

1. Start casa-pipe
   % casa-pipe -r 4.6.0-vlass
   Note: to see what versions available do
   % casa-pipe -ls

2. Inside this casa import the pipeline recipe, this one with no plotting
   > import pipeline.recipes.hifv_vlass_noplots as hifv_vlass_noplots

3. To run this recipe, 
   > hifv_vlass_noplots.hifv(['<sdmname>'])

4. wait for it to finish, about 15 hours for each 1 hour of data on a
   cluster node :(
